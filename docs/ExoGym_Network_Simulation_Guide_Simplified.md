# ExoGym Network Simulation Guide (Simplified)

This document explains how to simulate network conditions like bandwidth limitations and communication delays in ExoGym distributed training simulations.

## Understanding the Current Simulation

In our current setup with 3 nodes:

1. **Process-Based Simulation**: ExoGym creates 3 separate Python processes, each representing a node in a distributed system.

2. **Communication Pattern**: The nodes communicate using PyTorch's distributed package (`torch.distributed`), which by default uses the fastest available communication method with no artificial constraints.

3. **Synchronization Strategy**: We're using `FedAvgStrategy`, which implements Federated Averaging - nodes train locally for a certain number of steps (controlled by parameter `H`), then synchronize by averaging their models.

4. **Default Network Behavior**: By default, ExoGym doesn't simulate network constraints - communication between processes happens at the maximum speed allowed by your hardware.

## Simulating Network Conditions

To simulate realistic network conditions like bandwidth limitations and communication delays, you need to modify ExoGym's communication layer.

### Understanding the Communication Layer

ExoGym's communication happens primarily in two places:

- **Strategy Classes**: These implement the communication patterns between nodes (e.g., `FedAvgStrategy`, `DiLoCoStrategy`)
- **PyTorch Distributed Functions**: The actual data transfer happens through functions like `all_reduce`, `broadcast`, etc.

### Adding Network Simulation

To simulate network conditions, you need to:

1. **Create a Network Simulator Class** that can:
   - Simulate network delay with jitter
   - Simulate bandwidth limitations
   - Simulate packet loss

2. **Patch PyTorch Distributed Functions** to use the network simulator

### Implementing Different Network Topologies

You can simulate different network topologies:

```
Fully Connected:    Ring:             Star:
                                        
  1 --- 2           1 --- 2             2
  |     |           |     |            /
  |     |           |     |           /
  3 --- 4           4 --- 3          1 --- 4
                                      \
                                       \
                                        3
```

- **Fully Connected**: All nodes can communicate with all other nodes
- **Ring**: Each node connected only to adjacent nodes
- **Star**: One central node connected to all other nodes

## Practical Implementation Steps

To implement network simulation in your ExoGym experiments:

1. **Create the Network Simulator Files**
2. **Modify Your Training Script**
3. **Run Experiments with Different Network Conditions**
4. **Analyze the Impact**

## Example: Simulating Different Network Conditions

You can simulate various network conditions:

```

      +---------------------------------------→

```

## Advanced: Simulating Real-World Network Conditions

For more realistic simulations, you can model real-world network conditions:

1. **Mobile Network**:
   - Bandwidth: 1-10 MB/s
   - Delay: 50-300ms
   - Packet Loss: 1-5%
   - High Jitter: 30-50%

2. **Datacenter Network**:
   - Bandwidth: 100-1000 MB/s
   - Delay: 0.1-5ms
   - Packet Loss: 0.001-0.1%
   - Low Jitter: 1-5%

3. **Cross-Continental Connection**:
   - Bandwidth: 10-100 MB/s
   - Delay: 100-500ms
   - Packet Loss: 0.1-1%
   - Medium Jitter: 10-20%

## Conclusion

By implementing network simulation in ExoGym, you can:

1. Test how distributed training algorithms perform under realistic network conditions
2. Compare different strategies for their robustness to network limitations
3. Develop new algorithms specifically designed for constrained network environments

This approach allows you to conduct comprehensive experiments on distributed training without needing multiple physical machines with actual network constraints.
